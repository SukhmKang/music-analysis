# music-analysis

**Ishan Balakrishnan & Sukhm Kang**

Project that detects beats within an inputted song (.wav file) and finds its tempo (beats per minute).

## Built With

**Python** (https://www.python.org/) \
**Pandas** (https://pandas.pydata.org/) \
**Wave** (https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html) \
**SciPy** (https://scipy.org/) \
**MatPlotLib** (https://matplotlib.org/)

## Algorithm Summary

Please see our academic paper, "Beat Detection Algorithm for Popular Music with Fast Fourier Transform," for an in-depth summary of the implementation, methodology, training, and testing of the algorithm. Download the paper [here](https://github.com/SukhmKang/music-analysis/raw/main/Paper%20Beat%20Detection.pdf).
